# Project-1
Team Beta - Project 1 - Gas Stations in Mexico

In order to run any test regarding requests from Google API or Google Maps, you need to pass your api_key on the config.py file.

NOTE: Be extra careful if running the cell that contains the requests to fill the missing values from the original CSV file, as it can pass up to 2400 requests. 
Right now it is written to get only the first five (head) but if that is erased, there is no limit set.
